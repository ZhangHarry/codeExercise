/**
 * Created by zhanghr on 2018/9/11.
 * We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

 I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

 Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower.

 However, when you guess a particular number x, and you guess wrong, you pay $x. You win the game when you guess the number I picked.

 Example:

 n = 10, I pick 8.

 First round:  You guess 5, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $5.
 Second round: You guess 7, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $7.
 Third round:  You guess 9, I tell you that it's lower. You pay $9.

 Game over. 8 is the number I picked.

 You end up paying $5 + $7 + $9 = $21.
 Given a particular n â‰¥ 1, find out how much money you need to have to guarantee a win.
